# cpplox
Lox Language implementation in C, code for the bytecode virtual machine

**N.B.** :
Look up the following:
ยง 6.7.2.1 13 (C specification)

*Within a structure object,
the non-bit-field members and 
the units in which bit-fields reside 
have addresses that increase in the order in which they are declared.*

*A pointer to a structure object, suitably converted,
points to its initial member (or if that member is a bit-field,
then to the unit in which it resides), and vice versa.
There may be unnamed padding within a structure object, but not at its beginning.*
